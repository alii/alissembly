# bench

this folder is for benchmarking speeds.

as you can see below, for counting down from 1000000, c is about 14x faster

but honestly, that's quick enough considering the loop is not optimized in v whereas we've written an optimized for loop in c

when compared to a more "similar" program in c, c still seems to come out on top by still around 14x which just goes to show that i am not a good programmer

none of this is very scientific, just i wanted to see how much faster c is compared to my own impl in v at a high level and honestly ive had so much fun building this fr
